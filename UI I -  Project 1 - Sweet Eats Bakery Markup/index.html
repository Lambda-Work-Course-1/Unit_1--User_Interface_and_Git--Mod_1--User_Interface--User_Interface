<!-- 
Step 1: Fork this pen so it's yours.
Step 2: Practice marking up this content using semantic HTML tags. 
	Remember that semantic markup provides meaning.  Here are a few tags you could consider using:
	<h1> through <h6> 
	<p>
	<header>
	<footer>
	<nav>
	<a>
	<section>
	<address>

	Don't worry about CSS here, The goal is to markup the page in a semantic way.  

Step 3: 
	Once you have completed marking the content up, you are done with the HTML portion of the two-part assignment.
